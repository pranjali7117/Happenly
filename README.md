# Event Planner - React, TypeScript, Context API

This application is a comprehensive event management system built using React, TypeScript, Context API with useReducer, and Tailwind CSS. The primary focus of the app is to demonstrate modern React patterns for state management using Context API and useReducer hook. The use of TypeScript ensures type safety and better developer experience, while the Context API efficiently manages complex state transitions across event creation, editing, and attendee management.
